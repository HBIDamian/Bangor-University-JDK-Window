# Bangor-University-JDK-Window
Opens the JDK Window. Code is Based for Bangor University as the program we had to use there constantly logs users out if they accidentally exit the program. This is my cheap work around. I don't know if this still works as I haven't been there for a while, and this code is 2 years old now.
